# Guide: Promoting Containers to Production with DockerPilot

## 🎯 What does promoting a container to production look like?

### 1️⃣ Configuration Preparation

First, you need to prepare a deployment configuration file (e.g., `myapp-deployment.yml`):

```bash
# Create deployment configuration
dockerpilot deploy init --output myapp-deployment.yml

# Edit configuration as needed
nano myapp-deployment.yml
```

### 2️⃣ Promotion Process

#### Example scenario:
```
dev → staging → prod
```

#### Promotion commands:

**From dev to staging:**
```bash
dockerpilot promote dev staging --config myapp-deployment.yml
```

**From staging to production:**
```bash
dockerpilot promote staging prod --config myapp-deployment.yml
```

**Or directly to production (if you don't have staging):**
```bash
# First you would need to create 'dev' or 'staging' environment
dockerpilot promote staging prod --config myapp-deployment.yml
```

### 3️⃣ What happens during promotion?

#### Automatic resource adjustments by environment:

| Environment | CPU | Memory | Replicas | Image Suffix |
|------------|-----|--------|----------|--------------|
| **dev**    | 0.5 | 512Mi  | 1       | `-dev`        |
| **staging**| 1.0 | 1Gi    | 2       | `-staging`    |
| **prod**   | 2.0 | 2Gi    | 3       | (no suffix)  |

#### Promotion process (steps):

1. **✓ Pre-promotion checks** (before promotion):
   - Check source environment health
   - Verify target environment readiness
   - Check if all required tests passed
   - Verify no blocking issues in monitoring

2. **⬆️ Deployment strategy**:
   - For **production**: `blue-green deployment` (safest)
   - For **staging**: `rolling deployment` (zero-downtime)
   - Automatic switching between old and new environment

3. **✓ Post-promotion validation** (after promotion):
   - Check health check endpoint (`/api/health`)
   - Verify all services are running correctly
   - Check performance metrics
   - Verify no errors in logs

### 4️⃣ Example command output

```bash
$ dockerpilot promote staging prod --config myapp-deployment.yml

Promoting from staging to prod...

✓ Source environment (staging) is healthy
✓ Target environment (prod) is ready
✓ All required tests have passed
✓ No blocking issues in monitoring systems

🔄 Starting Blue-Green Deployment...
  [████████████████████████████████] 100% - Building green environment...
  
✅ Green environment ready

✅ Traffic switched successfully
🔄 Removing old blue environment...

✓ Application is responding to health checks
✓ All services are running correctly
✓ Performance metrics are within acceptable ranges
✓ No error spikes in logs

✅ Successfully promoted to prod
```

### 5️⃣ Configuration Example

#### Resource changes during promotion to prod:
- **CPU**: increased to 2.0 (from 1.0 in staging)
- **Memory**: increased to 2Gi (from 1Gi in staging)
- **Replicas**: increased to 3 (from 2 in staging)
- **Strategy**: Blue-Green deployment (safest for production)

#### Example deployment.yml configuration:
```yaml
deployment:
  image_tag: 'myapp:latest'
  container_name: 'myapp'
  port_mapping: {'8080': '8080'}
  environment:
    ENV: 'production'
  volumes:
    'app_data': '/app/data'
  restart_policy: 'unless-stopped'
  health_check_endpoint: '/health'
  health_check_timeout: 30
  health_check_retries: 10
  network: 'bridge'
  cpu_limit: '2.0'
  memory_limit: '2Gi'
```

### 6️⃣ What to check before promotion?

1. ✅ Is the container running correctly in the source environment
2. ✅ Is data backed up (volume `app_data`)
3. ✅ Is configuration correct (especially passwords and environment variables)
4. ✅ Is port 8080 available in target environment
5. ✅ Do you have sufficient resources (CPU, memory) for target environment

### 7️⃣ Rollback

If something goes wrong, DockerPilot automatically:
- Detects problems during health check
- Rolls back changes
- Restores previous version

### 8️⃣ Monitoring

After promotion you can monitor the container:
```bash
# Monitor container
dockerpilot monitor myapp --duration 300

# Check deployment history
dockerpilot deploy history --limit 10
```

## 📝 Notes

- **IMPORTANT**: Make sure passwords and environment variables are properly configured for production
- **Backup**: Always backup data before promoting to production (volume `app_data`)
- **Testing**: Best to test promotion on staging first
- **Monitoring**: Monitor container for several hours after promotion
