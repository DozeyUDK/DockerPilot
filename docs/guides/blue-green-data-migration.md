# Blue-Green Deployment Data Migration

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### Problem:
Blue-green deployment was not migrating data from the active container to the new container, causing data and configuration loss.

### Solution:
Added automatic data migration during blue-green deployment:

1. **Named Volumes Migration**
   - Copying data between volumes using Docker containers
   - Automatic detection of shared volumes (no migration needed in that case)

2. **Bind Mounts Migration**
   - Checking if paths are shared (data is automatically available)
   - Copying data if paths are different

3. **Configuration Files Migration**
   - Automatic detection of databases (DB2, InfluxDB, PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Elasticsearch)
   - Copying configuration files from active container to new one

4. **Integration in Deployment Process**
   - Migration occurs after creating new container
   - Before validation and traffic switching
   - Both containers run in parallel during migration

## 🔧 Added Functions

### `_migrate_container_data(source_container, target_container, config)`
Main data migration function:
- Analyzes mounts in both containers
- Copies named volumes
- Copies bind mounts (if needed)
- Copies configuration files for databases

### `_copy_volume_data(source_volume_name, target_volume_name, container_name)`
Copies data between named volumes using Docker containers.

### `_copy_bind_mount_data(source_path, target_path, container_name)`
Copies data between bind mounts on the host.

### `_copy_container_files(source_container, target_container, source_path, container_name)`
Copies files from one container to another using `docker cp`.

## 📋 Supported Cases

### Databases:
- ✅ **DB2**: Copying `/database/config/` and `/database/data/`
- ✅ **InfluxDB**: Copying `/etc/influxdb2/` and `/var/lib/influxdb2/`
- ✅ **PostgreSQL**: Copying `/var/lib/postgresql/data/`
- ✅ **MySQL**: Copying `/var/lib/mysql/`
- ✅ **MongoDB**: Automatic detection
- ✅ **Elasticsearch**: Automatic detection

### Volume Types:
- ✅ **Named volumes**: Full data migration
- ✅ **Bind mounts**: Checking shared paths and copying if needed
- ✅ **Shared volumes**: Automatic detection (no migration needed)

## 🎯 How It Works

1. **Creating new container (blue/green)**
   - Container is created with the same volume definitions from config

2. **Data migration** (NEW!)
   - After creating new container
   - Before validation
   - Data is copied from active container to new one

3. **Validation**
   - Checking if new container works correctly
   - Health checks

4. **Traffic switch**
   - Switching traffic to new container
   - Final container uses the same volumes, so data is available

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Named volumes**: If volumes are different between containers, data is copied
2. **Bind mounts**: If they use the same host paths, data is automatically available
3. **Files inside container**: Only files in volumes are migrated - files in container without volumes are not moved (this is normal container behavior)
4. **Migration errors**: If migration fails, deployment continues with a warning (does not block deployment)

## 🚀 Benefits

- ✅ **Zero data loss** during blue-green deployment
- ✅ **Automatic migration** - no manual intervention required
- ✅ **Database support** - special handling for DB2, InfluxDB, etc.
- ✅ **Safe** - migration does not block deployment if it fails

## 📝 Usage Example

```bash
dockerpilot promote staging prod --config myapp-deployment.yml
```

During this process:
1. New container (blue/green) is created
2. **Data is automatically migrated** from active container
3. New container is validated
4. Traffic is switched
5. Old container is removed

All without data loss! 🎉
